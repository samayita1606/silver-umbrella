# Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry wheteher the current best result will bring overeall optimal result...
The core idea of greedy hence lies in finding local minimum/maximum in quest to find global minimum/maximum...

Few of very known greedy algorithms include:
- Prim's Algorithm
- Krushkal's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Kanpsack Problem
- Huffman Coding
- Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

## Advantages of Greedy Approach:
- The algorithm is easier to describe
- The algorithm can perform better than other algorithms

## Drawback of Greedy Approach:
- Greedy algorithm doesn't always produce the optimal solution.
